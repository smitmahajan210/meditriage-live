## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. 📝 Handwriting Digitization (OCR)
* **Problem:** Manual data entry from handwritten patient forms is slow and error-prone.
* **Solution:** Automatically extracts Patient IDs from handwritten images.
* **Tech:** Implemented using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** with the **VGG13** architecture for high-accuracy character recognition.

### 2. ⚡ Patient Risk Assessment (Triage)
* **Problem:** Emergency rooms need to instantly prioritize patients based on vitals.
* **Solution:** Predicts health risk levels (Critical, Urgent, Non-Urgent) based on 7 key bio-markers (Glucose, Insulin, BMI, Age, etc.).
* **Tech:** Powered by a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** Neural Network trained on clinical datasets.

### 3. 🖥️ Real-Time Dashboard
* **Interface:** Interactive UI built with **Streamlit** for seamless user experience.
* **Backend:** High-performance **FastAPI** backend handling asynchronous inference requests.
